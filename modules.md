# Modules

This list contains modules that you will be able to install on Regul.

You can install the modules in the following ways:

* Drag and drop a zip file directly into the program
* Drag and drop the module dll file into the program
* Select a zip or dll file in the settings
* Drag and drop module files into the Modules folder yourself. This method is **not recommended**, as there may be problems with updating modules. If you want to update the modules yourself, you are welcome.

To delete modules, you need to delete the files of the module you don't need in the Modules folder. The program must be closed, otherwise you will not be able to delete them.
